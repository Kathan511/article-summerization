# article-summerization
Created Flask app to summarize articles using NLTK Library. I used the Beautifulsoup library to extract
article information from provided Wikipedia link. MongoDB database attached to view previously
generated article's summary history.
Provided email service with SMTP to deliver article summary to clientâ€™s email address. Deployed to
Heroku.
